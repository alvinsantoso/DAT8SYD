Data science week 3 lesson 3
Test set approach, how can we make a model that generalizes well?
1. split dataset
2. train model
3. test model
4. parameter tuning
5. choose best model
6. train on all data

Bias - Variance - Tradeoff (laymen terms)=
A person with high bias is someone who starts to answer before you can even finish asking. A person with high variance is someone who can think of all sorts of crazy answers. Combining these gives you different personalities:

- High bias/low variance: this is someone who usually gives you the same answer, no matter what you ask, and is usually wrong about it;

- High bias/high variance: someone who takes wild guesses, all of which are sort of wrong;

- Low bias/high variance: a person who listens to you and tries to answer the best they can, but that daydreams a lot and may say something totally crazy;

- Low bias/low variance: a person who listens to you very carefully and gives you good answers pretty much all the time.


Cross Validation = a method to dealing the issues of bias-variance-tradeoff
