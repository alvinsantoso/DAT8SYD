data science week 4 lesson 2
unsupervised learning = trying to find structure of your data because the data itself doesnt really have a correlate relationship between 1 value to another (multidimensional data)

Clustering = grouping set of data based on similar attributes to find unknown relationship within the data set. for e.g. Fraud transactional in finance

K-Means = 

how do we know if clusters are any good = compare Cohesion and Separation
Cohesion = within 1 cluster, how clustered are each points within that 1 cluster(how effectives within 1 cluster)
Separation = how far and apart betwwen 1 cluster to another (how effectives between clusters)
in general we want separation to be high and cohesion to be low

basically cluster validation requires intuition of human nature to inspect the result

k-means popular because it's computational efficiency, simple algorithm and intuitive nature.

weaknesses = not suitable to deal for data with widely varying shapes and densities (picture, geospatial map)

generally k-means always range in the low value (1-10)
