Difference between Logistic VS Linear Regression


In linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous. It can have any one of an infinite number of possible values. In logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values.

For instance, if X contains the area in square feet of houses, and Y contains the corresponding sale price of those houses, you could use linear regression to predict selling price as a function of house size. While the possible selling price may not actually be any, there are so many possible values that a linear regression model would be chosen.

If, instead, you wanted to predict, based on size, whether a house would sell for more than $200K, you would use logistic regression. The possible outputs are either Yes, the house will sell for more than $200K, or No, the house will not.
